		<h1>Erik likes things</h1>
		<p>I was born and raised in New Mexico and actually grew up in the same house as my mom.<br></p>
		<p> Even as a little tyke I was into finding creative solutions. Ultimately that led me to going to art school<br>
		Then design school<br>
		... and eventually I found myself googling frontend dev...<br>
			which resulted in me attending DeepDive
